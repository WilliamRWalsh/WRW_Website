            <p class="about-text"><br/><br/><br/><br/>Ever since I was a tiny human, I knew that I wanted to be a computer engineer. Before I knew that orange was my favorite color, even before I realized that coffee was my life force, I knew that I loved engineering solutions for all types of situations. In fact, in the third grade we were asked to draw a picture of what we wanted to be when we grew up for a class art project and, while my classmates drew basketballs and ballet slippers, I drew a really poor excuse for a computer. Had I known that my mom would end up purchasing this art project at a charity auction and it would be hanging in our kitchen for everyone to see for all time, I would have tried much harder to make it look more like a computer and less like an old school nintendo controller but what can you do?<br/><br/>After successfully earning a degree in computer engineering, I can honestly say I am doing what I love. With 7+ years of experience in software development, I am proficient in GIS, web development, and several programming languages.<br/><br/>Previously, I worked for the Geography Department at the University of Maryland developing fire detecting algorithms using satellite data. Before that I was an engineer at NASA's Goddard campus managing data for dozens of remote sensing algorithms.<br/><br/>Interested in: web development, game design, and machine learning</p>
